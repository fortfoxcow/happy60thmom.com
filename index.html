You really, really liked that show, and cried while watching the last episode. A man and a woman, lovers, ran toward each other on a beach, but were shot by Communist soldiers before they could share a final embrace. It was pretty sad. I cried too.</td>

When I was upset that I didn't win, you wouldn't let me whine or feel sorry for myself. I probably didn't always appreciated at the time, but I think this made me a stronger person.</td>
